# Intelligent Traffic Light Control System

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent traffic light control system using MATLAB, image processing, and computer vision. The system analyzes real-time traffic conditions through images or video feeds and dynamically adjusts traffic signal durations to improve flow and reduce congestion.

## Features
- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Detects vehicle density from images or video feeds.
- **Adaptive Signal Timing**: Adjusts green light duration based on traffic congestion.
- **Image Processing Techniques**: Utilizes grayscale conversion, edge detection, and connected component analysis.
- **Scalable Implementation**: Can be extended to multiple intersections for city-wide optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: MATLAB
- **Libraries**: Image Processing Toolbox
- **Concepts**: Computer Vision, Image Processing, Algorithm Development

## Implementation Details
1. **Traffic Data Acquisition**: Captures images or video frames from cameras.
2. **Image Processing**: Converts images to grayscale, applies edge detection (Canny), and detects vehicles using connected component analysis.
3. **Vehicle Counting**: Uses `bwconncomp` to count vehicles in each frame.
4. **Dynamic Signal Adjustment**: Adjusts green light duration based on vehicle count.
5. **System Output**: Displays processed images and sets traffic light duration accordingly.


## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration**: Use deep learning for improved vehicle detection.
- **Smart City Integration**: Coordinate multiple intersections for optimal traffic flow.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Provide live traffic data visualization.

## Conclusion
This system leverages computer vision and real-time data processing to optimize traffic light control, reducing congestion and improving efficiency.
